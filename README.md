## 1.4. How React Native Works
### UI Cmps
React ``<div>`` = Native Cmp (Android) ``android.view`` = Native Cmp (iOS) ``UIView`` = React Native ``<View>``  
React Native is going to compile ``<View>`` to the ``UIView`` for iOS and to the ``android.view`` for the android!

### Logics
But the Logic in a React-Native app WON'T BE COMPILED to the native language (Java or Swift), instead of that React-Native itself works like a native app on the mobile device and RUNS __JavaScript thread hosted by the react native__.  

It's like that: if you want to access the camera, your JS code will run a such a "JS Core VM" which through a __Bridge__ communicate with the Native Platform Modules and APIs.
